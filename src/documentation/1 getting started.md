## Getting started
If you are an experimentalist, an educator or an enthusiast, we recommend you simply jump in and explore. Look at the pre-run simulations, the evolution of life history traits over time. Afterwards, browse parameters, modify them and observe how they affect the evolution of life history.

If you are a theorist, consider to start by browsing the ODD protocol. It will provide the model designer's view â€“ broader context, list of entities, processes and design concepts. Afterwards, play with the parameters and inspect how they influence the evolving population.
