oneliner: AEGIS is an agent-based model for studying evolution of life history.
summary:
  - Life histories – set of traits specifying how organisms develop, reproduce and age – vary greatly across the tree of life as evolution attempts to maximize fitness under the extrinsic and intrinsic constraints.
  - >
    Main goal of the field of life history evolution is to develop and refine and explanatory framework for this diversity, 
    which is not only useful for understanding the large-scale heritable traits but is also crucial in explaining evolution of all fitness-modifying traits (e.g. behavior, pigmentation).
  - >
    Classical life history theory relies on optimality models which assume that selection maximizes some measureable metric that defines fitness by adjusting set of life history traits given modeled constraints.
    Alternative theoretical models – such as matrix population models / invasability models, game theoretic models, dynamic energy budget models, and others.
  - >
    These have been developed 
    to expand the abilities of classical models (e.g. with matrix population models; to handle density-dependence or to handle various population dynamics – from stable to cyclical or chaotic),
    to study specific scenarios (e.g. with game theoretic models; to model interactions between pairs) or 
    to leverage concepts from other fields (e.g. with dynamic energy budget model; to consider energy balance – energy uptake, storage and use).

abm_benefits: >
  phenomena emerge (bottom-up); components assumed, overarching phenomena are not; they demonstrate emerging phenomena
  allows for simulatenous modeling of many traits (age, size, genetics, strategy); modeling of heterogeneity in populations
  ..biorealism
  ..good for studying ratio of effects
  spatial dynamics
  temporal dynamics
  interactions with individuals (competition, predation, mating) and with the environment
  adaptive behavior (learning)
  complexity (many components/factors and interactions simultaneously)
  trajectories, temporality
  drift (non-adaptive evolution)
  accessibility (more than other methods); understandable and easily usable
  with increasing computational power, relevance of agent-based modeling increases as computational intensity is its main bottleneck

  summary: AEGIS is a scientific and educational tool for studying how
    evolution of age-specific survival and reproduction rates is shaped by various
    factors –
    demographic constraints (e.g. carrying capacity, population dynamics),
    mortality factors (e.g. predation, infection, environmental hazards),
    basic biology (e.g. mutation rate, recombination rate, mode of reproduction),
    and other life history traits (e.g. maximum lifespan, age to maturity, age at menopause).
